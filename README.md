Semi Automated House using Arduino

With the increase in consumption of energy and population, there is a grave need to conserve energy in every way possible. This framework is intended to do the same and to help and give help to satisfy the needs of the elderly and the handicapped at houses. Additionally, the idea of home automation system will improve the normal living status at houses. A smart home will take advantage of its environment and allow seamless control whether the user is present or away. With a home that has this advantage, you can know that your home is performing at its best in energy performance.  The system design does not remove the existing electrical switches and gives a safer control over the switches with low voltage usage technique. The switches status is synchronized everywhere each person interface demonstrates the current existing switch status. This system is designed to control electrical devices throughout the house with ease of installing it, ease of use and cost effective design and implement.
